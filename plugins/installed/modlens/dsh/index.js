 * whose stream() is a one-line delegation back to the real route. Pick the
 * wrapped model in the model selector, paste, and the request-time rewrite
 * turns the image into evidence text before the delegated request goes out;
 * the upstream serializer's own image rejection stays as the fail-closed

 * - `config.upstream` set: wrap exactly that one route, legacy behavior.

 *   wrapper, so a machine with several subscription packages (opencode-go,
 *   zai, ...) wraps them all instead of hand-picking one. A `discover` array
 *   of provider ids narrows the set. Routes that register late (llm-pi-ai
 *   mounts its routes after settings load) are picked up by re-sweeping on
 *   the registry's own `llm/adapters-updated` notification, no polling. The
